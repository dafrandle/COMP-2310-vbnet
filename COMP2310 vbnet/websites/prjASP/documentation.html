    <h4>Problem 1</h4>
    <p>The biggest problem i had was a textbox (which is not present anymore). The text box was on the delete items page [myDataView.aspx] <br />
    and was where the drop down is now. I wanted users to type the number of the recored into the text box they wanted to delete. <br />
    problem was, it wouldn't update my SQL statement builder unless i pressed enter which called the sub that ran the SQL statement <br />
    <br />
    This frustrated me immensely.
    <br /><br />
    After 4-5 hours of trying to make the textbox work, a night of sleep, and a shift of work, I took a new approach In that time i<br />
    had figure that a textbox would be cumbersome for me because i would have to validate it, so i changed it to a drop down.<br />
    I later learned all i had to do was add [AutoPostBack="True"] into the element declaration on the .aspx page </p>
    <h4>Problem 2</h4>
    <p>everything else I experienced this project is dwarfed by problem 1. However, one other (minor) problem i had was with the table on [editDB.aspx]<br />
    It was not displaying the entries in ascending order of the GameID field. this stumbled me but then i figured to add an ORDER BY statement to the SQL string<br />
    This didn't work with the dropdown on [myDataView.aspx] unfortunately.<p/>
